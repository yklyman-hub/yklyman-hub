    <h2>Structured Thinking. Deep Emotional Insight.</h2>

    <p>
      Hi, My name is Joshua Klyman, certified Couples Coach. At 36 and based in Tel Aviv, I bring a unique blend of analytical precision and deep human understanding to my work as a certified couples coach. With both an undergraduate and master’s degree in Engineering, I was trained to think in systems — to identify root causes, understand complex dynamics, and design practical, lasting solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      That same systems-based mindset allows me to help couples see the patterns in their communication, emotional triggers, and recurring conflicts — and transform them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout my academic journey, I completed extensive coursework in psychology, complementing my technical background with a strong foundation in human behavior and interpersonal dynamics. I have completed multiple professional couples coaching programs and am certified in couples coaching, equipping me with proven frameworks to guide partners toward clarity, connection, and growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      In parallel, I serve as the CTO of an American company, leading global teams and navigating high-level communication, leadership, and conflict resolution daily. This experience gives me unique insight into high-performing individuals balancing demanding careers with meaningful relationships.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am a native English speaker and fluent in Hebrew, working comfortably with both Israeli and international couples. When I’m not coaching, you’ll likely find me walking my 11-year-old dog along the Tel Aviv coastline — a reminder that strong relationships, like strong systems, thrive with intention and care.
    </p>
